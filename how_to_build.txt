Prerequisites:
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 (or relevant msbuild binaries).
- A copy of Cinema 4D (we build against R18.011).

1) Open Cinema4DSourceTools.sln in a text editor, modify the cinema.framework
path to point towards the framework you are using.

2) Open projectsettings.props and modify 'MAXON_ROOTDIR' to be the root of your
Cinema 4D installation directory.

3) Open the solution in Visual Studio 2013, you should now be able to compile
without issue (make sure you set the Cinema4DSourceTools project as the startup project).
Upon compilation the plugin will automatically be copied to the Cinema 4D directory and
overwrite any other Cinema 4D Source Tools installation present.
Depending on the framework you use certain function calls may not
exist, work, or work differently then expected, we currently build against
R18.011.
