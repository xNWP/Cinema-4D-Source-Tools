NOTE: This is an experimental build, some features may not work as intended, or at all.

We currently build against Cinema 4D R21.107

1. Make sure you've cloned the repository with --recurse-submodules to include needed submodules.

2. Extract the frameworks folder from the sdk.zip file in your Cinema 4D directory (default is: C:\Program Files\Maxon Cinema 4D R21) to the root of the C4DST directory. (Don't extract folders from frameworks, just have the entire frameworks folder in the root of C4DST.)

3. Download the latest project tool from the Maxon developer website: https://developers.maxon.net

4. Generate project files from a terminal with the following command: kernel_app_64bit.exe g_updateproject=<path_to_c4dst>\Cinema-4D-Source-Tools

5. Open the generated solution file located at: plugins\project\plugins.sln

5a. If you are asked to upgrade the project, you should be fine upgrading the SDK, however do not upgrade the build tools.

6. Build the sourcetools project as per usual.

== Debugging Setup (optional) ==

7. Select your Cinema 4D executable as the debugging command.

8. Add the following command parameters to automate loading of the plugin: g_additionalModulePath=$(ProjectDir)..\..

== Profiling Setup (optional) ==
9. Define the preprocessor macro 'ST_PROFILING' on the sourcetools project to have benchmarking data printed to the c4d console.
